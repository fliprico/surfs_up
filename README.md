# surfs_up

##Overview of the analysis
We spent sometime with new tools such as SQLite, SQLAlchemy, and Flask to build on our knowledge of SQL databases structures and querying methods. We also wrote and executed Python code in a Jupyter notebook and created graphs using Python.

The purpose of the project was to explore business development opportunities to establish a Surfing & Ice-Cream shop in Hawaii. The purpose of the concept is to provide a one stop Surfboard rental for locals and tourists whilst also being a rest spot for people to relax and have Ice Cream or a Shake!
